<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are some scripts to monitor memory and cpu of processes out there. However, I found that most of them do not seem to work out of the box, require additional configuration and seem to be faily complex. 

So here is what I am attempting to accomplish with this project:
* Offer a simple solution to a simple request - measuring a process' cpu and memory and saving it to a csv file
* Create something that works out of the box and that is easy to setup
* Provide something that is easy to use, especially for those of us who have very little experience in coding/ bash/ process monitoring
